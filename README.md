### [Berlekamp–Massey algorithm](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BC_%D0%91%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%8D%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%B0_%E2%80%94_%D0%9C%D1%8D%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8)

The Berlekamp—Massey algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest shift register with linear feedback for a binary sequence submitted to the input. The algorithm also allows you to find the minimum polynomial of a linear recurrent sequence submitted to the input over an arbitrary field.
